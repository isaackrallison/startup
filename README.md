## Elevator Pitch
Have you ever had some friends together and tried to decide on what to do?
<br>
How about when you are with your family trying to decide where to go to eat?
<br>
It can be tough to decide on a choice that makes everyone happy,
<br>
especially when there’s a big group. So why not take a quick vote on it!
<br>
With this startup the decision can be made in just a few minutes.
